# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a classic game of Rock Paper Scissors, built using JavaScript with basic HTML and CSS for styling. The game provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive buttons for players to select their choice of rock, paper, or scissors. Once the player has made their selection, the game compares it with the computer's randomly generated choice, and a winner or loser is declared.
